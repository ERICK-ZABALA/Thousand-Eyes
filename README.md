# ThousandEyes

## OVERVIEW

This example is an integration between Thousand Eyes and Slack using Python. Thousand Eyes sends alert notifications via our webhook service and those notifications are received in the Web Server API deployed as an application in the cloud of Heroku. The Web Server API is hosted in the Heroku Cloud send the notifications to Slack device using an incoming webhook of Slack that is a simple way to post messages from external sources (third parties).

     * apiMessage.py ------> Submit POST Request to Slack if there is any incomming alert from Thousand Eyes, that is just a module an the application trying to use this when run main.py.
 
     * main.py ------> Activate your Web Server API using flask framework to receive POST request from Thousand Eyes Webhook service.
       In the main.py as you can see, to use a module, the application just needs to import the module and use its functions using the dot notation.
